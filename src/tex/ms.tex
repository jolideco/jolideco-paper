    \begin{abstract}
        We present a new method for Joint Likelihood Deconvolution (Jolideco) of a set of astronomical observations of the same sky region in the presence of Poisson noise. The method reconstructs a single flux image from a set of observations by optimizing the \aposteriori joint Poisson likelihood of all observations under a patch based image prior. The patch prior is parameterised by a Gaussian Mixture model (GMM) and learned from astronomical images with high signal to noise ratio, such as the James Webb Telescope. During the reconstruction process the patch prior adapts  to the structures in the data by finding the most likely GMM component for each patch in the image. By applying the method to simulated data we show that both the combination of multiple observations as well as the patch based prior lead to an much improved reconstruction quality in many different source scenarios as well as signal to noise regimes. We show also that the method yields superior reconstruction quality to alternative standard methods such as the Richardson-Lucy method. We also show that the method can be highly adapted to various analysis scenarios by learning problem specific GMM prior  such as images of extragalactic or Galactic sources.

    \section{Introduction}
    The resolution of any physical or astronomical imaging process is inherently limited by the instrument or telescope used. Furthermore, the quality of the resulting image is affected by background or instrumental measurement noise and non-uniform exposure. This is especially true in the low signal-to-noise regime, where images are affected by Poisson noise. This includes images taken by \xray and \gammaray~telescopes but also images obtained with positron emission tomography or single-photon emission computed tomography.

    To maximise the scientific use of available data it is desirable to correct for the instrumental imprint on the data as well as reduce its noise level. The process of improving the resolution of an image in post-processing is called de-blurring or de-convolution, as the the data is obtained via a forward convolution through the point spread function (PSF) of the instrument. In general this class of problems is called inverse problems. If there is prior information available on the shape of the PSF, we typically refer to the process more precisely as un-blind de-convolution. In case of astronomical observations the PSF can for example be estimated empirically from observation of known point sources, such as distant activate galactic nuclei or a model of the PSF can obtained from simulation of the telescope or instrument.
    
    
    \subsection{Related Work}
    In literature there have been many efforts to solve the un-blind deconvolution problem for images affected by Poisson noise. Most methods rely fundamentally on modeling the image generating process as a linear process. Given a known point spread function a prediction of the discrete measured image can be obtained via \textit{forward folding} and be compared against an observation assuming Poisson statistics per pixel. However the methods differ in their additional prior or regularisation assumptions as well as their approach to optimization or sampling of the underlying likelihood function.
    
    The standard baseline method for image de-convolution was proposed independently by \cite{Richardson1972} and \cite{Lucy1974} (we will further refer to this method as \textit{RL}). The method involves estimating the original image by iteratively convolving the observed image with the PSF and dividing by the result of convolving the estimated image with the transposed PSF. The iterations continue until the estimated image converges to a satisfactory solution. 

    However in practice the RL method was found to have multiple, partly related limitations: first there is no objective criterion when to stop the optimization process. Usually the iteration is stopped when the reconstructed image seems plausible to the eye. Second, when the number of iterations is too high, the method shows a tendency to decompose regions of constant brightness into a set of bright emission peaks (\textit{speckles}). This problem was e.g. described and studied by \cite{Reeves1995} and \cite{Fish1995}. Lastly the RL method does not provided an associated estimate of the uncertainties of the reconstruction, which is desirable especially in the Poisson domain to measure the significance of specific features found in the reconstructed image.
    
    To address the question of when to stop the RL iteration \cite{Reeves1995} proposed to use cross validation. The authors of \citep{Bi1994} proposed a bootstrapped based assessment of the significance of reconstructed image as as a stopping rule for RL.
    
    To address the issue with RL decomposing extended emission structures into groups of point source, multiple additions to the RL method were proposed. Most importantly this lead to the introduction of regularised RL methods.
    such as use of total variation \citep{Dey2006} or sparseness \todo{add reference}.

    Multi-scale LIRA prior has been used in image deconvolution to incorporate error estimates and Bayesian sampling. This prior has been used in various studies, including those by \cite{Esch2004} and \cite{Connors2011}. However, the prior is ad-hoc and lacks physical information or assumptions, limiting its applicability.

    Another approach to image deconvolution is joint likelihood RL, which has been shown to be effective in creating a merged image from multiple images \cite{Ingaramo2014}. In this approach, RL takes the best out of each image and merges them to create a more accurate representation of the object.

    An alternative approach to solve the problem in the framework of information field theory. Recently, image deconvolution using physical assumptions and decomposition into point and diffuse flux in 3D/4D has gained attention. \cite{Pumpe2018} and \cite{Selig2015} proposed priors based on physical assumptions, which have been shown to work well for large-scale emission. However, the smoothness assumption in these methods can lead to artifacts in the galactic plane.

    The challenge is due to fundamentally contradicting goals: deconvolution favoring point sources will decompose extend structures, while introducing local correlations will lead to 
    
    \cite{Zoran2011} build on very similar assumption for natural images.
    Instead of assuming a fixed local correlation structures, such as smoothness
    they proposed to learn the local correlation structure on millions of patches
    extracted from natural images. 
    
    For this they proposed to split training images from representative
    data sets into small patches of size 8x8~pixels and fit a 64 dimensional
    Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to the distribution of extracted patches. Each pixel of the patch 
    is thereby treated as an independent dimension in the model. In total
    they chose to use $k=200$ Gaussian components.
    
    To use the GMM in reconstruction they introduce the expected patch likelihood (EPLL). 
    
    They showed that the patch based GMM prior led to much improved image reconstructions for multiple inverse problems such as de-noising, de-blurring and inpainting.

    \cite{Bouman2016} later adapted the patch prior reconstruction to be used

    \subsection{Some Remarks on Deep Learning Methods}
    In the past decade Machine learning (ML) especially deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) became the \textit{de facto} standard for de-blurring and super-resolution of natural images \todo{reference review?}. However their success relies on the availability of massive sets of training data with typically low noise and corresponding ground truth to perform supervised learning. For a variety of reasons, which we will outline in the following, this approach is not ideal for astronomical x-ray and \gammaray data.
    
    First astronomical x-ray and \gammaray data data is rare, expensive to obtain and there is no ground truth, because we can only observe the sky with our given instruments. To circumvent this one could rely on transfer learning and simulated data. For example radio or optical images could be forward folded with a known PSF model and be degraded with Poisson noise to generate training data. However astronomical images still have a large dynamic range and show a high diversity in morphological structure, which would still require a large amount of training data. However this approach has been successfully applied for specific classes of sources, such as images of Galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) \citep{Schawinski2017} or as a post processing step of results obtained with regularised RL \citep{Akhaury2022}.

    In addition to the challenge of obtaining training data, it is known that the PSF of instruments such as \chandra is highly variable. It varies with observation conditions and depends e.g. on energy as well as offset angle from the pointing direction. To cover the whole parameter space of the PSF one would need to train either a network for each of the PSF models, or define a very large network, which would require a very large computational effort.

    Some of the challenges of de-blurring with CNN are due to the convolutional nature of the networks. In a single layer, linear approximation, the network would need to learn the inverse filter of the PSF, corresponding to the well known \textit{Wiener filter} solution of the problem. This requires large convolution kernels or deep network architectures. \cite{Li2014} have introduced a baseline architecture for a deep CNN for image de-blurring by introducing large kernels under the separability assumption.
    
    One last important challenge is obtaining uncertainty estimates for the reconstructed image from CNNs. In the limit of Poisson noise it is desirable to trace the full a-postiori likelihood, which is not possible for most network architectures, with the exception of for example normalising flows.

    \section{Method}
    \subsection{Poisson Joint Likelihood}
    Our goal is to recover an image $\mathbf{x}$ from a set of multiple low counts observations. Most generally we assume our total dataset consists of $J$ individual observations of the same region of the sky, which we jointly model. The assumption is that the underlying, unknown \textit{true} emission image, we are interested in, does not change with time. Under this assumption these datasets can be for example:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Different observations of one instrument or telescope at different times and observation conditions. E.g., multiple observations of \chandra of the same astrophysical object with different offset angles and exposure times
        \item Observations from different telescopes, which operate in the same wavelength range. E.g., a \chandra and \xmm observation of the same region in the sky
        \item A single observation of one telescope with different data quality categories and different associated instrument response functions, such as event classes for \fermi
    \end{itemize}

    Or even an arbitrary combination of the possibilities listed above. 
    
    For each individual observation $j$ the predicted counts can be modelled by \textit{forward folding} the unknown flux image $\mathbf{x}$ through the individual instrument response:

    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:model}
        \boldsymbol{\lambda}_j(\mathbf{x}) = \mathrm{PSF}_j \circledast \left(\mathbf{E}_j \cdot (\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{B}_j) \right)
    \end{equation}

    Where the expected counts $\lambda_j$ are given by the convolution of the unknown 
    flux image $\mathbf{x}$ with the observation specific point spread function $\mathrm{PSF}_j$. Additionally
    an observation specific image of the exposure $\mathbf{E}_j$ and background emission $\mathbf{B_j}$ can be
    optionally taken into account.

    Given a single observation $j$ of an unknown flux image
    $\mathbf{x}$ and assuming the noise in each pixel $i$ in the recorded counts image
    $\mathbf{D_j}$ follows a Poisson distribution, the likelihood $\mathcal{P}$
    of obtaining the measured image from a model image of the expected
    counts $\boldsymbol{\lambda_j}$ with $N$ pixels is given by:

    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:poisson}
        P\left( \mathbf{D_j} | \boldsymbol{\lambda_j} \right) = \prod_{i=1}^N \frac{{e^{ - D_{j,i} } \lambda_{i,j} ^ {D_{j,i}}}}{{D_{j,i}!}}
    \end{equation}

    By taking the logarithm and dropping the constant terms one can transform the
    product into a sum over pixels, which is also often called the \textit{Cash}
    \citep{Cash1979} fit statistics:

    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:cash}
        \mathcal{C}\left( \mathbf{D_j} | \boldsymbol{\lambda_j} \right) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \lambda_{j,i} - D_{j, i} \log{\lambda_{j,i}}
    \end{equation}

    To account for the possibility of different datasets having a different number of pixels we divide by $N$ (\todo{Does this need more justification...?}).
    By summing over all observations we finally get the joint log-likelihood of measuring a set of counts images $\mathbf{D}$ given an unknown flux image $\mathbf{x}$:

    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:joint}
        \mathcal{L}\left( \mathbf{D} | \mathbf{x} \right) = \sum_{j=1}^J \mathcal{C}\left( \mathbf{D_j} | \mathbf{x} \right)
    \end{equation}

    Using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) we could try to get an estimate $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ directly,
    using some optimization procedure. However in general this represents an \textit{ill posed}
    inverse problem. Estimates for $\mathbf{x}$ which have similar likelihood values $\mathcal{L}(\hat{\mathbf{x}_1})$ look very different from each other and might also look different compared to a given ground truth, if available. 
    Both the convolution operation as well as the level of noise lead
    to a loss of information in the data which cannot easily be recovered.
    The likelihood surface shows many local, close-by minima. Depending on the initial estimate for $\mathbf{x}$ and the minimization algorithm the MLE based estimate
    is likely to only find such a local minimum. This is fundamentally the reason for RL decomposing estimates into point sources, described in the previous section. 
    
    \todo{did you know this sum corresponds to the loop over data sets in machine learning...?}

    \subsection{A Posteriori Joint Likelihood}
    When reconstructing images in the context of inverse problems we are operating
    in a high dimensional parameter space, because each pixel in the image represents
    an independent parameter in the optimization process. By using prior information
    we can introduce correlations between the parameters, to reduce the \textit{effective}
    dimensionality of the problem and guide the optimization process towards unique 
    and more stable solutions.
    
    Using Bayes rule we can estimate the \aposteriori likelihood under a given prior:

    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:bayes}
        P(\mathbf{x}|\textbf{D}) = P(\mathbf{x} ) \frac{P(\textbf{D} |\mathbf{x})}{P(\textbf{D})}
    \end{equation}

    And use a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) approach to find an estimate for $\mathbf{x}$.
    Taking the logarithm of Eq.~\ref{eq:bayes}, replacing the definition of the likelihood
    $P(\mathbf{D}|\mathbf{x})$ with Eq.~\ref{eq:joint} and dropping the normalisation term $P(\mathbf{D})$
    which is independent of $\mathbf{x}$, we get the following expression for the log-posterior
    likelihood $\mathcal{L}$ :
    
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:total}
        \mathcal{L}\left(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{D} \right) = \sum_{j=1}^J \mathcal{C}\left( \mathbf{D}_j | \mathbf{x} \right) - \beta \cdot \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{x})
    \end{equation}

    Where $\mathcal{C}\left( \mathbf{D_j} | \mathbf{x} \right)$ represents the summed log-likelihood
    for an individual observation $j$. Additionally the function includes a log-prior
    term $\mathcal{P}(\mathbf{x})$ and a factor $\beta$ to adjust the weight of the prior with respect to the joint log likelihood term. The parameter $\beta$ can be seen as a hyper-parameter, chosen by the user
    to quantify their belief in the correctness of the chosen prior distribution.
    \todo{this is somewhat dissatisfying...but in practice very common...see e.g. any kind of regularisation...if there is enough data cross validation could be used to tune this hyper-parameter}.

    \subsection{Patch Based Image Prior}
    In general it is difficult to capture global image statistics in a prior likelihood taking into account all pixel to pixel correlations. The size of the corresponding correlation matrix would grow with the number of pixels squared and thus quickly becomes computationally untraceable. However astronomical images typically only show local correlations between pixels. This is because the spatial scale of astrophysical processes in an image is always limited by the finite interaction time and the fact that the interaction cannot propagate faster than the speed of light (structure in the CMB might be an exception here). This means on smaller scales astronomical images often contain basic structures such as edges, corners, filaments or periodic patterns formed by local astrophysical processes. For this reason we adopt the same patch based image prior approach as introduced by \cite{Zoran2011}. We use a pre-trained Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to evaluate and approximate a patch based prior for the reconstructed image $\mathbf{x}$.
    
    One convenient property of the GMM is the possibility to evaluate its likelihood in closed form. For a given single patch $\mathbf{x}_n$ it is given by:

    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:gmm}
        P_{GMM}(\mathbf{x}_n) = \sum_{k=1}^K \pi_k \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_n| \boldsymbol{\mu}_k, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_k^2)
    \end{equation}

    Where $\mathcal{N}$ is a Gaussian distribution, $K$ the total number of components, $\boldsymbol{\mu}_k$ the vector of means for a given component $k$, $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_k$ the corresponding covariance matrix
    and $\pi_k$ the weight of the component. The different weights are required to sum to unity such that $\sum_{k=1}^N\pi_k = 1$. 

    From Equation~\ref{eq:gmm} we can also derive the log-likelihood for a specific choice of the component $k$:
        
    \begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
    \mathcal{P}_{GMM}(k| \mathbf{x}_n) = -\frac{1}{2} \left[ \right. d \log(2\pi)
    + \log(|\boldsymbol \Sigma_{k}|)\\
    + (\mathbf{x}_n - \boldsymbol{\mu}_{k})^T \Sigma^{-1}_{k}(\mathbf{x}_n - \boldsymbol{\mu}_{k}) \left. \right]
    \end{split}
    \end{equation}

    If we split the image into non-overlapping patches, we can find for each noisy patch $\mathbf{x}_n$ the GMM component $\hat{k}_n$, which maximises the log-likelihood of the GMM:
        
    \begin{equation}
        \hat{k}_n = \underset{k \in \{1, ..., N\} }{\argmax}{\mathcal{P}_{GMM}(k| \mathbf{x}_n)}
    \end{equation}
    \vspace{0.2em}

    As the number of components in the GMM is limited we can do this simply by evaluating the likelihood for each of the components and choose the one with
    the maximum value of the log-likelihood. To finally evaluate the log-likelihood
    of the total image we can sum up the log-likelihood of the individual patches: 

    \begin{equation}
        \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{k}) = \sum_{n = 1}^N \mathcal{P}_{GMM}(\hat{k}_n | \mathbf{P}_n \mathbf{x})
    \end{equation}

    Where $\mathbf{P}_n$ is a matrix that extracts the $n$-th patch
    from the image $\mathbf{x}$ to be reconstructed. This way the index $k$ that identifies the GMM component becomes a discrete hyper-parameter in the model that is optimized along with the image $\mathbf{x}$.
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the case of non-overlapping patches is rather simple
        \item for overlapping patches we have to make a few more approximations
        \item either we neglect the correlation between overlapping patches
        \item or we have to optimize the array of $\mathbf{k}$ at the same time, instead of "per patch optimization". However optimization on discrete 
        values is not easily possible in Pytorch. However here is one idea:
        group the GMM components by similarity and introduce a single continues
        parameter $z$, which interpolates between similar components.
        \item Another idea is to use "Gumbel Softmax"...
        \item we also compute the mean of the likelihood for the overlapping parts
    \end{itemize}

    To use the learned GMM as prior for the reconstruction of another image, the image is split into overlapping patches. For each of the patches the log-likelihood for each of the GMM components is evaluated. The resulting grid of overlapping patches is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:patches}.

    \begin{figure}
        \script{patches.py}
        \begin{centering}
            \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/patches.pdf}
            \caption{
                Grid of overlapping patches of size 8x8 pixels. The overlap size was chosen to be 2 pixels.

        \end{centering}
    \end{figure}

    with radio astronomy data.
    They have shown that the reconstructed image only weakly depends on the choice
    of the reference data on which the the patch prior is learned. They found
    equivalent results for GMMs learned on natural images and specifically
    simulated images of black hole ring structures.

    Using half quadratic splitting and the Wiener filter solution, which is not possible
    in our case. Instead we choose a direct optimization by relying on differentiable
    programming later. 
    

    \subsubsection{Image Normalisation and Dynamic Range}
    Astronomical images typically show a much higher dynamic range compared to 
    natural images. This is mostly due to the existence of point sources, which
    rarely occur in natural images. Astronomical point sources typically relate
    to compact bright objects, such as active galactic nuclei at high distances,
    or binary objects and stars at Galactic distances.
    
    The high dynamic range of astronomical images challenges any deconvolution method.
    To recover point sources accurately it is required to keep correlations with
    neighbouring pixels low, while for extended source the opposite is true. Ideally
    those contradicting requirements can be handled with a single flexible prior assumption,
    which adapts to the data, such as the patch based GMM prior introduced in the previous
    section.

    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:patch-norm}
        \tilde{\mathbf{x}}_n = f \left(\frac{\mathbf{x}_n - \Bar{\mathbf{x}}_n}{\Bar{\mathbf{x}}_n} \right)
    \end{equation}

    With a given non-linearity:

    \begin{equation}
        f(x) = \arcsinh{x / \alpha}
    \end{equation}

    \todo{The patch normalisation remains to be decided, but it would be advantageous to get rid of the hyper-parameter associated with the total image normalisation}.
    The GMM patch prior is learned from other images whose pixel intensities
    have no physical relationship of the intensities of the Poisson data we are
    dealing with. To overcome this the GMM is learned on normalized images,
    where the intensity values are constrained between 0 and 1.
    To evaluate the GMM patch prior on the 
    model image $\mathbf{x}$ the pixel values of $\mathbf{x}$  need to be mapped 
    in the same dynamic range between 0 and 1. Multiple common choices for such a
    mapping function are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:image-norms}. 


    In practice we are interested in the likelihood of a given structure in a patch and
    So we subtract the mean value of a given patch. This represents the assumption that
    the image structure is independent of the total flux contained in the patch.
    

    \begin{figure}
        \script{image-norms.py}
        \begin{centering}
            \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/image-norms.pdf}
            \caption{
                Various image norms with different dynamic behaviour.
            }
            \label{fig:image-norms}
        \end{centering}
    \end{figure}

    The choice of the image normalisation allows to adjust the contrast of the image
    and e.g. enhance low intensity structures, which also enhances the regularising
    effect of the patch prior. 

    \todo{Which normalisation to choose, atan, asinh, log, inverse-cdf?}

    There are arguments for $\arcsinh(\mathbf{x})$, see e.g. \cite{Lupton2004}, which we use.

    \subsubsection{Cycle Spinning}
    To avoid artifact due to the choice of the grid of overlapping patches we propose
    three variations:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Cycle spinning by randomly shifting the image by a given number of pixels in x and y direction, e.g. used in \cite{Esch2004}
        \item Sub pixel cycle spinning, by randomly distributing the brightness of a given pixel to a 4 pixel grid \todo{This is something I came up with to allow for point sources to have sub-pixel positions, but I never showed it actually works...}
        \item A randomly chosen patch grid, such that each pixel is at least covered once.
        The random grid of patches was proposed by \cite{Parameswaran2018}. This has the advantage of potentially speeding up the computation as well. \todo{It is available in the implementation, but a bit "ad hoc", maybe just not mention...}
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Cross Validation}
    Cross validation (CV) is an established method for model selection in statistics
    and machine learning to prevent over-fitting the data. To perform CV the available
    data is slit into a "training" and "validation" dataset. While optimizing the
    log-likelihood value is monitored 
    
    The use of multiple dataset allows to use cross-validation to prevent overfitting.
    One of the standard techniques in "machine learning"...

    Cross validation is feasible once sufficient data is available, which is e.g. the 
    case for deep \chandra~observations.

    CV as stopping rule for RL was proposed by \cite{Reeves1995}...

    \subsection{Systematic Errors of Predicted Counts}
    Each measured counts image $\mathbf{D_j}$ is associated with systematic errors.
    This includes e.g. the pointing accuracy of the telescopes: when repeatedly pointed
    to the same object or when using different types of telescopes for observation, the
    absolute position of an astronomical object might vary in the image between different
    observations. The process of correcting for these inaccuracies is called \textit{astrometry} and a standard procedure in for example \chandra data analysis.
    A second example of systematic errors is the variation of background emission
    between multiple observations.
    
    To account for both systematic effects we extend the model for the predicted
    counts introduced in Eq.~\ref{eq:model}, by a background normalisation factor
    $\alpha_j$ and a linear shift in position $\phi_j(\mathbf{x}| \delta_{x,j}, \delta_{y,j})$, which is specific for each observation. This yields the following modified model definition:
    
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:model-npred-calibration}
        \mathbf{\lambda}_j = \mathrm{PSF}_j \circledast \left(\mathbf{E}_j \cdot (\phi_j(\mathbf{x}| \delta_{x,j}, \delta_{y,j}) + \alpha_j \cdot \mathbf{B}_j) \right)
    \end{equation}
    
    In practice one observation is used as a reference and its corresponding
    systematic shifts in position $\delta_{x,j}, \delta_{y,j}$ are frozen during
    optimization. An example of the effect of the positional shift and background
    normalisation can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:npred-systematics}.

    \section{Implementation}
    \subsection{Jolideco Framework}
    The goal of the reconstruction process is to optimize the a-posteriori
    likelihood defined by Equation~\ref{eq:total}. Given that each pixel
    in the reconstructed image represents an independent parameter
    this represents a high dimensional optimization problem.
    Differentiable programming frameworks such as \texttt{PyTorch}~\citep{Pytorch2019}
    allow for solving these kind of high dimensional modeling problems, by using
    back-propagation and adapted optimization methods for high dimensional
    models such as stochastic gradient decent.

    We implemented the \jolideco method as an independent Python package, 
    based on \texttt{PyTorch} as optimization back-end. We tried to define a modular,
    object oriented code structure, to allow parts of the algorithm to be
    flexible and interchangeable, such as choice of image normalisation scales,
    the choice of GMM models, optimization methods and serialisation formats for the 
    reconstruction results as well as corresponding diagnostic information
    such as the trace of the posterior and prior likelihood values.
    The package is available at \url{https://github.com/jolideco/jolideco}

    We also use \texttt{Numpy}~\citep{Numpy2020} for handling data arrays and
    \texttt{Matplotlib}~\citep{Hunter2007} for plotting.
    To learn the Gaussian Mixture Models from patches we use the standard implementation
    provided in the \texttt{Scikit-Learn}~\citep{Skimage2014} package. To handle the 
    serialisation of images to the \textit{FITS} data format and to handle world coordinate
    systems (WCS) we use \texttt{Astropy}~\citep{Astropy2018}.
    For optimization and internal data handling we use \texttt{PyTorch}.

    \subsection{Jolideco GMM Library}
    \label{ssec:jolideco-gmm-library}
    On radio data \cite{Bouman2016} found the results to be mostly independent of the choice of data the GMM prior was learned on. The strength of the GMM prior is its high \textit{expressiveness}, meaning the prior contains a large variety of patch shapes and adapts to the data in the optimization process. However in the low signal-to-noise regime we typically expect a higher dependence of the results on the choice of the data the GMM was learned on. The choice of the prior becomes more important and to avoid introducing a strong bias it should be adapted to the analysis scenario. For this reason and for purposes of testing we learned and provide a selection of GMMs (a \textit{Library}) to be used with the patch prior for download in a \textit{GitHub} repository\footnote{\url{https://github.com/jolideco/jolideco-gmm-library}}.
    
    \subsubsection{Zoran \& Weiss}
    As baseline reference GMM we use the original model provided by \cite{Zoran2011}. The model was learned from the Berkley image database \todo{reference}, which contains natural images and image and every day scenes and objects. The model was learned by splitting the images into 8x8 patches and provided by the authors as part of the source code for download\footnote{\url{https://people.csail.mit.edu/danielzoran/epllcode.zip}}.
    More details of how the model was learned are given in the original publication.
    
    \subsubsection{GLEAM Radio Data}
    \label{sssec:gleam-radio-data}
    As an alternative we consider a prior learned from astronomical radio data. For this we relied on high signal to noise radio data from the \textit{GLEAM} survey \cite{HurleyWalker2022}. We downloaded the data using the Gleam VO Client\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ICRAR/gleamvo-client}}. We restricted the choice of data to the Galactic Plane between $b=\pm10\deg$ and $\ell = \pm180\deg$ to avoid a bias towards extra-galactic point sources and represent structures of Galactic sources with rich morphology, such as supernova remnants, pulsar winds etc. The data set still includes Galactic as well as extra-galactic point sources in the background. There is also physical correlation between e.g. the very high energy \gammaray and radio range as their emission is produced by the same electron populations.

    
    In total we extracted \todo{insert number} patches and trained a GMM with 128 components. We used "data augmentation" by introducing a random shift of the sub-pixel position.

    \subsubsection{JWST Cas A Image}
    As a last GM prior we use the promotional image of JWST realeased by...
    The image is particularly suited becasue of the excellent angular resolution, extrating many patches for the same object
    as well as the high signal to noise ratio. 
    
    \subsubsection{NRAO Jets, Jets, Jets}
    \todo{Include the jet prior or not?}
    For the specific application of jet detection and analysis in extract galactic data we learned a GMM patch prior from radio jet images. It represents the prior knowledge of both the morphology and preferred direction of the jet. As reference data we chose
    a PR image released under the name \textit{Jets, jets jets}  by the NRAO collaboration containing ~150 example jets from their data\footnote{\url{https://public.nrao.edu/gallery/quicklook-samples/}}.

    We first split the compiled image into 150 individual examples. For each image we ran a blob detection algorithm and line fit to find the preferred direction of the jet. Using this information we aligned all images to the same horizontal reference direction of the jet split all images into patches of size 8x8 pixels. In total we extracted \todo{insert number} patches and used those to train a GMM with 32 components. The prior is useful in a scenario were the direction of the jet known from e.g. previous radio observations. 

    Alternatively we used a \textit{data augmentation} approach to learn a GMM prior with a randomized direction of the jet. For this we rotated the jet image after alignment by 
    a random angle. Then again we split each image into patches of size 8x8 pixels. In total we created \todo{insert number} patches and learned a GMM with 64 components. The prior
    is adapted to the analysis scenario of jet detection, where no prior knowledge on the
    direction is available.

            \label{fig:gmm-eigen-images}
        \end{centering}
    \end{figure}

    \subsubsection{Chandra SNRs}
    \label{sssec:chandra-snrs}. Because of the limited statistics we did not use any oversampling but kept the pixel
    Astrophysical processes forming the morphological structures are typically self-similar \todo{provide physical argument...I guess it is just the distance distribution?}. Structures appear on multiple angular scales. This means the prior could even be learned from the data itself if sufficiently free of noise. For analysis of Galactic sources with complex morphology and typically radially symmetric features such as supernova remnants (SNRs) we learned a prior from images of the bright \chandra SNRs \textit{Cas A} and \textit{G292.0+01.8}. In total we extracted \todo{insert number} patches and learned a GMM with 128 components.


     
    \subsection{Computational Performance}
    We conduct as series of performance benchmarks (see Appendix?) to asses the scalability of the method to a large number of observations
    as well as large images. 

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Results are available in \url{https://github.com/jolideco/jolideco-benchmarks}
        \item We tried the binary search tree as proposed in \cite{Parameswaran2018},
        but without success, most likely because the native \texttt{Pytorch} support
        for parallelisation speeds up the standard GMM quite a bit...
        \item Could use a Neural Net for GMM component selection as proposed in \cite{Rosenbaum15}
        \item GPU support via \texttt{Pytorch}

    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Optimization Strategy}
    Maximising the \aposteriori likelihood defined Eq.\ref{eq:total} with respect to the model parameters $\mathbf{x}$ is a high dimensional optimization problem. To improve the convergence rate of the optimization process we employ the following optimization strategy: the optimization strategy begins with the optimizer viewing $\log{\mathbf{x}}$, and the first step involves running a rough estimate using a uniform prior. This step is optional, but if chosen, the next step involves optimizing the parameters associated with the systematic error described in Eq.~\ref{eq:model-npred-calibration}. Following this, a full optimization is performed using the patch prior, which can be computationally expensive. The optimization algorithm used is ADAM, a stochastic gradient descent method, without decay. Finally, there is an optional step of learning rate scheduling, although so far, a fixed step size value of $\mathrm{lr}=10^{-3}$ has been used.
    
    In practice we employ the following optimization strategy:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the optimizer sees $\log{\mathbf{x}}$, note this corresponds to an "implicit" prior of the flux being positive...
        \item First run with uniform prior, to get a rough estimate
        \item (optional) Then optimize the parameters associated to the systematic error described in Eq.~\ref{eq:model-npred-calibration}.
        \item Then we go for a full optimization using the patch prior, which can be computationally costly
        \item we use ADAM (stochastic gradient decent), without decay
        \item  (optional) learning rate scheduling? So far just a fixed step size value of $1e-3$
    \end{itemize}

    We use the test datasets provided by Vinay et al.
    First we evaluate the performance of the method on a set of simulated observations.
    For this we assume:

        \item An instrument with good angular resolution, but low effective area (e.g. like Chandra)
        \item An instrument with worse angular resolution, but higher effective area (e.g. like XMM)

    For both scenarios we assume a Gaussian PSF of sizes $\sigma = 2$ pixels and  $\sigma = 5$.
    As true flux we consider the following scenarios:

        \item Spiral and point sources of varying brightness

    \subsection{Methods}
    \label{subsec:methods}
    We compare the performance of \jolideco with different prior assumptions and against the \textit{LIRA} method introduced by \cite{Esch2004}. More specifically we use the following methods:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Pylira}: first we use the \textit{LIRA} method \citep{Esch2004} via the \textit{Pylira} Python wrapper \citep{Donath2022}. We rely on the default prior definition and allow the scale for the background to vary. In total we run the the sampling process for 5000 iterations and use 500 iterations as a "burn-in" period to allow the MCMC chain to converge. Then we compute the mean of the posterior distribution ignoring the burn-in period.
        
        \item \textbf{Jolideco (Uniform, n=10)}: second we use \jolideco with a uniform prior and 10 iterations. This setup we consider as a baseline method reference similar to RL. While the optimization procedure is different, we still expect to see similar behaviour for the local correlations of pixels. This ad hoc approach of "early stopping" is often used in practice to "regularise" the RL method.
        
        \item \textbf{Jolideco (Uniform, n=1000)}: again we use \jolideco with a uniform prior but running for 1000 iterations. Sames as above except without early stopping. This gives rise to the issue of RL decomposing extended emission into point sources. 
        
        \item \textbf{Jolideco (Patch, GLEAM v0.1)}: \jolideco with a patch prior learned on GLEAM data, described in Section~\ref{sssec:gleam-radio-data}. It also uses the standardised patch normalisation as described by Equation~\ref{eq:patch-norm}. We use cycle spinning, a stride of 4 pixels and 1000 iterations. Which optimizes "to the end" until there is no relevant change in the posterior log-likelihood. In addition we use and upsampling factor of 2.
        
        \item \textbf{Jolideco (Patch, Zoran-Weiss)}: \jolideco with a patch prior from \cite{Zoran2011} and the mean subtracted patch norm. This is for comparison to the original method and the method used on \cite{Bouman2016}. We use maximum image norm with the maximum values defined by the ground truth \todo{is this fair?}.
    \end{itemize}

    We ran the comparison on the whole parameter grid of methods, source scenarios, background levels and instrument scenarios. However in the following we only discuss a subset of the results, which we consider the most relevant. All results are available at \url{https://jolideco.github.io/jolideco-comparison}.

            }
            \label{fig:comparison-scenarios}
        \end{centering}
    \end{figure*}
    %
    First we compare the performance of methods on the different source scenarios.
    Figure \ref{fig:comparison-scenarios} shows the comparison of the methods for a selected subset of scenarios A1, B3, C3 and D4. 
    
    On scenario A1 all methods show acceptable to excellent results for the isolated point sources in the upper right of the image. This demonstrates all methods take into account the PSF and background model model correctly. The early stopped uniform prior still shows an extension for those cases, because the optimization process has not finished. Optimizing for 1000 iterations clearly improves the result and shows almost perfect point sources corresponding to the size of approximately one pixel. The \jolideco method with the Zoran-Weiss patch prior results in less sharp images, because the prior has been learned on natural images of landscapes and every day objects and scenes, which do not include point sources. The \jolideco method with the prior learned from GLEAM data, which also includes point sources, shows much improved results. However not as sharp as the results obtained with the uniform prior. In the lower left of the image the point sources become fainter and move closer, challenging all methods in succeeding to separate those as independent sources. The uniform prior optimized "to end" shows excellent results, still separating the sources. 
    
    For scenario B3 all method recover the point sources and the central extend source. 
    However large difference can be observed in the reconstruction of the Gaussian shaped extended sources. As expected the uniform prior decompose the emission into many point sources, neglecting the spatial correlation between them. \textbf{Pylira} shows slightly improved results with the gaps between the bright emission peeks being more filled, however still lacks a convincing result into reconstructing the source as a single object. The \jolideco method with the patch priors shows the best results both visually as well as measured by the SSI. The GLEAM v0.1 patch prior reconstructs the 
    sources almost perfectly, visually indistinguishable from the ground truth. The Zoran \& Weiss prior also shows good reconstruction of the extended sources, but less smooth and leaving a visible extension in the surrounding point sources.

    Scenario C3 challenges the methods to reconstruct a weak extended source under four brighter point sources. While again all methods reconstruct the point sources well, the visual differences are large for the weak underlying extended emission. The uniform prior with 1000 iterations 
    
    \jolideco shows excellent performance of a variety of morphological shapes. 
    it converges to the reference solution for very high signal to noise.


    \par{\textbf{Pylira}}
    Pylira shows 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Shows good results for point sources
        \item Slightly improved results on extended source, but still "speckly"
        \item Pixels loose spatial correlation over larger scales..
    \end{itemize}

    
    \par{\textbf{Jolideco, Uniform Prior n=1000:}}
    The uniform priors show the expected behaviour: decompose into point sources, when "optimized to the end".
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the uniform priors show the expected behaviour: decompose into point sources, when "optimized to the end".
        \item yields very good results, if the true underlying source are only point sources
        \item results are very bad, once extended emission is present. Result is "speckly" with no visible spatial correlation between nearby pixels.
    \end{itemize}

    \par{\textbf{Jolideco, Patch Prior GLEAM}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item shows best results
        \item slightly worse results on point sources only
        \item visually very close to ground truth (!)
        \item good compromise between sufficient separation of point sources and good reconstruction of extended sources.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Comparing Signal-to-Noise Scenarios}
    %
    \begin{figure*}
        \script{comparison-signal-noise.py}
        \begin{centering}
            \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/comparison-signal-noise.pdf}
            \caption{
                Comparison of the \jolideco method with the GLEAM v0.1 prior for different background levels and signal strength represented by scenario D1-5. The images are grouped by background levels with each column group showing the counts data in the left column and the reconstruction in the right column. The rows show the scenarios D1-5 as described in Section~\ref{subsec:test-datasets}. The background levels correspond to \qty[mode = text]{0.001}{cts / pixel}, \qty[mode = text]{0.01}{cts / pixel} and \qty[mode = text]{0.1}{cts / pixel}. The complete results for the simulations and additional information are available at \url{https://jolideco.github.io/jolideco-comparison}. \todo{the background handling does not yet seem right...maybe we should let the background norm free}
            }
            \label{fig:comparison-signal-noise}
        \end{centering}
    \end{figure*}
    %
    As a second experiment we explored the dependency of the results on background level and signal strength. Figure~\ref{fig:comparison-signal-noise} shows the results for the \jolideco method with the GLEAM prior in the scenario D1-5. As expected the reconstruction quality improves with signal strength. The method seems to converge to the ground truth for very high signal-to-noise ratio.

    Es expected once the signal strength becomes very large there is no dependency of the result on the background level anymore (scenario D5)

    
    \todo{We should give a single number for the S/N, how to compute? Per source, like spiral ring and point sources...}    

    Some observations:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 
        \item there seems to be a "jump" in the reconstruction quality of the point sources. The weakest is much more blurry, but all the others look fine.
        \item the method "fails" at the highest background level.
    \end{itemize}



    \subsubsection{Comparing Instrument Scenarios}
    %
    \begin{figure*}
        \script{comparison-instruments.py}
        \begin{centering}
            \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/comparison-instruments.pdf}
            \caption{
                Comparison of the \jolideco method with the GLEAM v0.1 prior for the different instrument scenarios. The images are grouped by instrument scenario with each column group showing the counts data in the left column and the reconstruction in the right column. The rows show the scenarios D1-5 as described in Section\ref{subsec:test-datasets}. 
                All results are available at \url{https://jolideco.github.io/jolideco-comparison}.
            }
            \label{fig:comparison-instruments}
        \end{centering}
    \end{figure*}
    %
    Finally we compare the results from the \jolideco method for the different instrument scenarios. Figure~\ref{fig:comparison-instruments} shows the data as well as flux images reconstructed using \jolideco and the GLEAM v0.1 patch prior. We consider the source scenario D1-5 and the instrument scenarios and of \chandra, \xmm and combining both for a single reconstructed image. 

    Using the \chandra data alone results in a solid reconstruction at all variations of the D scenario. As expected the reconstruction quality improves for higher signal to noise ratio. 

    Using just the data from the \xmm instrument scenario results in lower quality reconstructions. However the spiral arm structure is reconstructed at all levels of the signal. The spiral arm structure is not really visible from the data by eye, because it is heavily blurred by the limited angular resolution.

    Combining the data results in the best reconstruction quality. This confirms the results from \cite{Ingaramo2014}, that combining multiple measurements for deconvolution with RL was "general tool for combining images with complementary strengths".

    \begin{itemize}
        \item surprising reconstruction quality for XMM with a strong signal
        \item combining the data results in the best reconstruction
        \item for a strong signal adding the "XMM" data improves the "Chandra" result for extende sources. It further reduces the "speckliness"
        \item not understood: reconstruction of point source becomes worse as spiral becomes brighter. Maybe because the strong signal dominates the likelihood function? Not sure how to improve this...it is image dynamics...
        \item confirm results by , the method takes "the" best pout of two different measurements. 
    \end{itemize}
    
    \section{Application Examples}
    \subsection{Deep \chandra Observation}
        
    \begin{figure*}
        \script{example-chandra.py}
        \begin{centering}
            \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/example-chandra.pdf}
            \caption{
               The \jolideco method applied to \chandra data of the SNR E0102. The left large image shows the summed counts from 25 observations. The right large image  shows the result from the \jolideco de-convolution process. The flux is given as counts relative to the reference observation with ID=1308.
               The panels \textit{Zoom A} and \textit{Zoom B} show a zoomed-in version of two example regions in the SNR, marked with the white rectangles in the large images.
            }
            \label{fig:example-chandra}
        \end{centering}
    \end{figure*}

    As a first application example for real data we choose a set of 25 short exposure observations of the SNR \textit{E0102} by the \chandra telescope and combine them into a single deep observation using \jolideco and the patch prior learned from JWST data. In total we chose 25 observations (same list of observation IDs as for \url{https://chandra.si.edu/photo/2009/e0102/}) taken with with the ACIS instrument and no grating. For \chandra the instrument response varies with the observation offset and energy \todo{reference}. With \jolideco we can handle  PSF for each observation. We assume a spatially constant background of \qty[mode = text]{1e-5}{ct/pixels}. 
    We also assumed the exposure to be spatially constant. Its absolute value for each observation we expressed as the ratio of observation time with respect to the reference observation. As reference we chose the observation id 1308.
    We reduced the data \textit{ciao} v4.15 and a custom \textit{snakemake} workflow (see Section~\ref{sec:reproducibility}). The PSF were simulated for each observation independently using \textit{marx} \todo{reference} and the \textit{simulate\_psf} script. The complete list of observation IDs can be found online. We selected the energy range from \qty[mode = text]{0.5}{keV} to  \qty[mode = text]{7}{keV} and a bins size of 0.25 "native" bins, corresponding to a bin size of \qty[mode = text]{0.001}{$\deg$/pixel} \todo{How large is the Chandra PSF compared to this?}. As reference spectrum for the PSF simulation we assumed the model derived by \cite{Plucinsky2017}. We converted the spectral from XSPEC to sherpa script using the helper script \textit{convert\_xspec\_script}.

    For \jolideco we used the GMM prior learned on the JWST image Cas-A and an oversampling factor of 2. For each observation we allow the background level and position calibration to vary. Figure~\ref{fig:example-chandra} shows the final result. \jolideco improves both the angular resolution as well as signal to noise ratio of the counts image.

    \textit{Zoom A} shows an example for a filamentous structure in more detail. \jolideco maintains the extended structure along the filament, while sharpening in the perpendicular direction. Looking at the upper right one can also see that weak background emission is suppressed, also improving the contrast of the image. \textit{Zoom B} shows a another circular filamentous structure of the SNR. In the counts data the structure is barely visible, while the image reconstructed by \jolideco shows a circular structure with a bright emission spot. 

    \todo{Showing residuals does not really make sense here the SNR seems to extend with time...this is clearly visible in the residuals..or ist the the exposure time calibration that changes? One could run on the Zoom A individually and the per obs shift might account for the motion with time...}

        \end{centering}
    \end{figure*}
    As a second example we apply the \jolideco method to data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT).
    The LAT is a pair conversion \gammaray telescope on board of the Fermi satellite. It operates in the energy range between \qty[mode = text]{30}{MeV} to  \qty[mode = text]{300}{GeV}. For this example we chose again a Galactic source with complex morphology: the supernova remnant \textit{Vela Junior}. We use 14 years (from 2008 August 4 to 2023 August 4) of \texttt{P8R3\_SOURCE} photons with reconstructed energy in the range of \qty[mode = text]{10}{GeV} to  \qty[mode = text]{2}{TeV} and applied a zenith angle cut of \ang{105}. To preserve as much information as possible on the angular resolution of the instrument we split the data into the four event types \texttt{PSF0}, \texttt{PSF1}, \texttt{PSF2} and \texttt{PSF3}, as defined by the \fermi collaboration. We chose a pixel size of \qty[mode = text]{0.02}{$\deg$}, which corresponds to approximately 1/5th of the size of the PSF in the best event class. For the first part of the data reduction we use the standard \textit{fermitools} \todo{add version and reference}.
    
    The \textit{fermitools} output an energy dependent counts, exposure and PSF cube. To further reduce the data to images we use the \textit{Gammapy} package. To compute an image of the expected background emission we rely on the latest Galactic diffuse emission model \texttt{gll\_iem\_v07.fits} and also include nearby sources from the 3FHL catalog \cite{Ajello2017}. We first fit the model components to the data, excluding a circular region of radius \qty[mode = text]{1.02}{$\deg$} centered on \textit{Vela Junior}. Finally we reduce this model to an image by summing over the energy dimension.
    To compute the exposure and PSF image we assume a power law with index $\Gamma=1.77$ \citep{Ajello2017} as a spectral model for \textit{Vela Junior} and integrate over the energy dimension of the cube while weighting with the spectral model.
    
    We chose the GMM patch prior learned from \chandra SNRs described in the Section~\ref{sssec:chandra-snrs}. Because of the limited statistics we did not use any oversampling but keep the pixel size of the counts image. Figure~\ref{fig:example-fermi-lat} shows the data, result and residuals. The \fermi data is sparse, with very limited statistics. \jolideco clearly improves the noise level as well as angular resolution of the data. It reveals morphological details consistent with the HESS measurement \todo{Add HESS image or EROSITA for comparison? But this is not an analysis...}
    The calibration of the predicted counts finds different background model norms and positional shifts in order of \todo{add value} for the different event classes. This way it corrects for systematic errors in the reconstruction of the position. 
    
     To check the quality of the model we compute a map of approximate residual significance defined by:

    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:approx-sigma}
        \sigma \approx \frac{\hat{N}_{\mathrm{Data}} - \hat{N}_{\mathrm{Pred}}} {\sqrt{\hat{N}_{\mathrm{Pred}}}}
    \end{equation}

    Where $\hat{N}$ is the weighted sum of counts from a Gaussian smoothing kernel.
    \todo{To account for the Poisson statistics it would be more precise to compute a "TS" map, but for an approximate estimation it should  be fine...I have a derivation for this formula }
    
    As a check we compute a map of residuals based on the predicted counts, the resulting distribution of residual significances per pixel is centered at $\mu=-0.001$ with a width of $\sigma=0.991$, indicating a close agreement with a unit \textit{Gaussian} distribution.

    \section{Summary \& Outlook}
    In this work we presented a new method for image de-convolution and de-noising in the presence of Poisson noise. From multiple observations of the same sky region we reconstructed a single flux image using the approximate MAP estimate of the joint likelihood under patch based GMM prior. We showed that the methods leads to improved results in variety of scenarios. Especially it leads to much improved results for extended source with a size similar to the PSF. In this case it allows to reliably recover features, that are well beyond the angular resolution of the instrument.

    We showed that the approach of joining multiple observations leads improved results and allows to maximize the use of existing observational data.

    We consider the \jolideco method as a first step into the territory of \textit{ML inspired} methods for reconstruction of astronomical image data dominated by Poisson noise. While we achieved already superior results to any other existing method, 
    the \jolideco methods shows large potential for future extension and improvements. 
    
    Firstly it is possibly to rely on more general mixture models such as a Student-T or a generalised Gaussian mixture model. Those more flexible functional shapes can account for tails in the distributions. Improved results on natural images have been reported e.g. by \cite{}.

    To further improve the expressiveness of the prior \cite{Altekrueger2022} used normalising flows to model the distribution of patches in the context of CT image reconstruction.
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Extend \jolideco to handle spectral dimension at the same time.
        \item Extend \jolideco to handle multiple source components at the same time.
        \item one could try deep image priors \citep{Ulyanov2017}
        \item Extend to use GMM patch prior on multiple scales, see \cite{Papyan2015}
        \item Exclude point sources either via separate component or "J-invariance"
    \end{itemize}

  

    We statistically combined data from existing telescopes to obtain a new \textit{virtual instrument}, with improved angular resolution and sensitivity. We invite the community of x-ray and \gammaray astronomers to use the method an combine data for new scientific discoveries, beyond the current angular resolution of existing instruments.
