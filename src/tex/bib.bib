    abstract = {Image restoration including deconvolution techniques offers a powerful tool to improve resolution in images and to extract information on the multiscale structure stored in astronomical observations. We present a new method for statistical deconvolution, which we call expectation through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (EMC2). This method is designed to remedy several shortfalls of currently used deconvolution and restoration techniques for Poisson data. We use a wavelet-like multiscale representation of the true image to achieve smoothing at all scales of resolution simultaneously, thus capturing detailed features in the image at the same time as larger scale extended features. Thus, this method smooths the image, while maintaining the ability to effectively reconstruct point sources and sharp features in the image. We use a principled, fully Bayesian model-based analysis, which produces extensive information about the uncertainty in the fitted smooth image, allowing assessment of the errors in the resulting reconstruction. Our method also includes automatic fitting of the multiscale smoothing parameters. We show several examples of application of EMC2 to both simulated data and a real astronomical X-ray source.}

               image from corrupted observations. The Expected Patch
               Log-likelihood (EPLL) algorithm is a powerful image restoration
               method that uses a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior on the
               patches of natural images. Although it is very effective for
               restoring images, its high runtime complexity makes EPLL
               ill-suited for most practical applications. In this paper, we
               propose three approximations to the original EPLL algorithm. The
               resulting algorithm, which we call the fast-EPLL (FEPLL),
               attains a dramatic speed-up of two orders of magnitude over EPLL
               while incurring a negligible drop in the restored image quality
               (less than 0.5 dB). We demonstrate the efficacy and versatility
               of our algorithm on a number of inverse problems such as
               denoising, deblurring, super-resolution, inpainting and
               devignetting. To the best of our knowledge, FEPLL is the first
               algorithm that can competitively restore a 512$\times$512 pixel
               image in under 0.5s for all the degradations mentioned above

Our method ensures that an object with a specified astronomical color (e.g., g−r and r−i) has a unique color in the RGB image, as opposed to the burnt‐out white stars to which we are accustomed. A natural consequence of this is that we can use the same colors to code color‐magnitude diagrams, providing a natural “index” to our images. We also introduce the use of an arcsinh stretch that allows us to show faint objects while simultaneously preserving the structure of brighter objects in the field, such as the spiral arms of large galaxies. We believe that in addition to their aesthetic value, our images convey far more information than do the traditional ones, and we provide examples from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging, the Hubble Deep Field (HDF), and Chandra to support our claims.4}

    abstract = {Abstract The Richardson-Lucy (R-L) algorithm has been widely used to restore degraded astronomical images. This algorithm is nothing more than the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm applied to Poisson data. The R-L method is iterative in nature and converges to a (possibly local) maximum of the likelihood function. Unfortunately, because of the ill-conditioned nature of the problem, this maximum likelihood estimate may actually be a very poor restoration. One way to prevent degradation of the restoration is to stop the iteration before it reaches convergence. A number of methods have been proposed for determining the optimal stopping point-the point that provides the best trade-off between restoring the image and amplifying the noise. Cross-validation (CV) has recently been proposed as an advantageous method for determining the optimal stopping point. We propose a different form of CV based on generalized cross-validation (GCV) that overcomes some of the difficulties of CV. We derive a GCV-based criterion for the R-L algorithm that can be efficiently evaluated at each iteration. We present examples displaying the power of the stopping rule and discuss the abilities and shortcomings of the method.},

    abstract = {Abstract Confocal laser scanning microscopy is a powerful and popular technique for 3D imaging of biological specimens. Although confocal microscopy images are much sharper than standard epifluorescence ones, they are still degraded by residual out-of-focus light and by Poisson noise due to photon-limited detection. Several deconvolution methods have been proposed to reduce these degradations, including the Richardson–Lucy iterative algorithm, which computes maximum likelihood estimation adapted to Poisson statistics. As this algorithm tends to amplify noise, regularization constraints based on some prior knowledge on the data have to be applied to stabilize the solution. Here, we propose to combine the Richardson–Lucy algorithm with a regularization constraint based on Total Variation, which suppresses unstable oscillations while preserving object edges. We show on simulated and real images that this constraint improves the deconvolution results as compared with the unregularized Richardson–Lucy algorithm, both visually and quantitatively. Microsc.

    journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series},
    abstract = {We present a catalog of sources detected above 10 GeV by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) in the first 7 years of data using the Pass 8 event-level analysis. This is the Third Catalog of Hard Fermi-LAT Sources (3FHL), containing 1556 objects characterized in the 10 GeV–2 TeV energy range. The sensitivity and angular resolution are improved by factors of 3 and 2 relative to the previous LAT catalog at the same energies (1FHL). The vast majority of detected sources (79\%) are associated with extragalactic counterparts at other wavelengths, including 16 sources located at very high redshift (z &gt; 2). Of the sources, 8\% have Galactic counterparts and 13\% are unassociated (or associated with a source of unknown nature). The high-latitude sky and the Galactic plane are observed with a flux sensitivity of 4.4 to 9.5 × 10−11 ph cm−2 s−1, respectively (this is approximately 0.5\% and 1\% of the Crab Nebula flux above 10 GeV). The catalog includes 214 new γ-ray sources. The substantial increase in the number of photons (more than 4 times relative to 1FHL and 10 times to 2FHL) also allows us to measure significant spectral curvature for 32 sources and find flux variability for 163 of them. Furthermore, we estimate that for the same flux limit of 10−12 erg cm−2 s−1, the energy range above 10 GeV has twice as many sources as the range above 50 GeV, highlighting the importance, for future Cherenkov telescopes, of lowering the energy threshold as much as possible.}

    abstract = {In recent years, approaches based on machine learning have achieved state-of-the-art performance on image restoration problems. Successful approaches include both generative models of natural images as well as discriminative training of deep neural networks. Discriminative training of feed forward architectures allows explicit control over the computational cost of performing restoration and therefore often leads to better performance at the same cost at run time. In contrast, generative models have the advantage that they can be trained once and then adapted to any image restoration task by a simple use of Bayes' rule.In this paper we show how to combine the strengths of both approaches by training a discriminative, feed-forward architecture to predict the state of latent variables in a generative model of natural images. We apply this idea to the very successful Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) of natural images. We show that it is possible to achieve comparable performance as the original GMM but with two orders of magnitude improvement in run time while maintaining the advantage of generative models.},
